# PIDController
Ridgebotics vision stuff. Logistics are a pain, but it's simpler than it looks.
This is still a work in progress, and so half the stuff is missing.
TODO:
  Finish PID for turn left
  Finish code for the other three
  Create "runner" program
  Tune K values
  Actually test code
  Debug, and loop again to 8.
  Ask Stadudacher for the basics on vision just to piss hiim off.
